== Objectives

. Allows writing your testable `CQRS/ES` model with minimal dependencies.
. Allows consistently handling your commands and save resulting events into `Postgres`.
. Allows projecting events to your read models.

== Premisses

* Using https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/[Vertx] to implement a `non-blocking IO` event store.
* Idiomatic Kotlin: type safeness: pattern matching, honouring your constructors.
* Immutability: state transitions occurs after computing results of pure functions `(State, Event) -> State`.
* https://github.com/crabzilla/crabzilla/blob/main/crabzilla-vertx-pgclient/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/pgclient/command/CommandController.kt[CommandController] is consistent by default: before handling a command, your state ID is pessimistically locked using https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS[Postgres Advisory Locks]
* https://github.com/crabzilla/crabzilla/blob/main/crabzilla-vertx-pgclient/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/pgclient/projection/EventsProjectorVerticle.kt[EventsProjectorVerticle] allows handling your read model projection's strait from database: no need to publish your events to Kafka or NATS.
* You can even use https://vertx.io/docs/#clustering[Vertx Clustering] to deploy your EventsProjectorVerticle instances. Projections with singleton clustered verticles (singleton writers) and also with High Availability built in Vertx :)
* JSON serialization using https://kotlinlang.org/docs/serialization.html[Kotlin serialization] (other implementations are welcome).
