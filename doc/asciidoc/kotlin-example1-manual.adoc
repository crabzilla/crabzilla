Status: *WORK IN PROGRESS*

Let's examine the crabzilla-example1. It has just one aggregate: Customer.

* An user can create a new customer
* An user can activate an existing customer
* An user can deactivate an existing customer
* An user can create and activate a new customer

== 1.0 crabzilla-example1-core

A library containing your domain model expressed in value objects, aggregates, commands, events, etc.
Internal services and repositories are just plain domain abstractions: interfaces or abstract classes. The scope is
probably a _Bounded Context_. This module is also 100% agnostic about how data will be persisted to a relational
database. This is called _persistence ignorance_. But it is aware of the JSON format needed to persist its commands,
events, units of work, etc

==== 1.1 Events

[source,kotlin]
.CustomerData.kt
----
include::./crabzilla-example1/crabzilla-example1-core/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/example1/customer/CustomerData.kt[tags=events]
----

==== 1.2 Commands

[source,kotlin]
.CustomerData.kt
----
include::./crabzilla-example1/crabzilla-example1-core/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/example1/customer/CustomerData.kt[tags=commands]
----

=== 1.3 Internal Services

Any internal service is expressed as an abstraction. No implementations within core module. And very important: *internal
services can  be blocking but must be side effect free*.

[source,kotlin]
.services.kt
----
include::./crabzilla-example1/crabzilla-example1-core/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/example1/services.kt[tags=service]
----

=== 1.4 Read Model

Any repository is expressed as an abstraction. No implementations within core module.

[source,kotlin]
.readmodel.kt
----
include::./crabzilla-example1/crabzilla-example1-core/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/example1/readmodel.kt[tags=readmodel]
----

Example1 domain is built of functions. So far we didn't had to worry about any implementation detail. Example1 domain
can be easily tested with mocks and stubs.

== 2.0 crabzilla-example1-handler

Aggregates, functions to handle command and events and also implementations for your services and repositories.

==== 2.1 CommandValidatorFn

A non blocking and side effect free function:
[source,kotlin]
.CustomerFunctions.kt
----
include::./crabzilla-example1/crabzilla-example1-handler/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/example1/customer/CustomerFunctions.kt[tags=CommandValidatorFn]
----

==== 2.2 CommandHandlerFn
A possibly blocking and NO side effect free function. Although not being side effect free (may throws an RuntimeException), command
handler verticles will wrap the result of this function into a result type something like https://github.com/crabzilla/crabzilla/blob/master/crabzilla-core/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/core/entity/EntityCommandResult.kt[EntityCommandResult]
[source,kotlin]
.CustomerFunctions.kt
----
include::./crabzilla-example1/crabzilla-example1-handler/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/example1/customer/CustomerFunctions.kt[tags=CommandHandlerFn]
----

==== 2.3 StateTransitionFn

A non blocking and side effect free function:
[source,kotlin]
.CustomerFunctions.kt
----
include::./crabzilla-example1/crabzilla-example1-handler/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/example1/customer/CustomerFunctions.kt[tags=StateTransitionFn]
----

=== 2.4 Aggregates

An aggregate runs *side effect free* business logic and returns events. It can uses internal services and repositories.
[source,kotlin]
.Customer.kt
----
include::./crabzilla-example1/crabzilla-example1-handler/src/main/java/io/github/crabzilla/example1/customer/Customer.kt[tags=aggregate]
----

== 3.0 crabzilla-example1-projector
