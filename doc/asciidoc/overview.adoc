Status: *WORK IN PROGRESS*

== Goal for version 1.0.0

To help you write your domain model with very little framework overhead and smoothly deploy it on a state of art Java 8
reactive applications platform backed by a rock solid relational database of your choice.

== Status

So far Crabzilla has only an Aggregate example. Inspired by http://eventstorming.com/[Eventstorming], the goal is to
also develop examples and implementations for an ExternalSystem, a Listener and a ProcessManager / Saga.

== Modules

Crabzilla has 2 modules:

 crabzilla               → Project root
  └ crabzilla-core       → Command, DomainEvent, Aggregate, Snapshot, etc
  └ crabzilla-vertx      → Crabzilla engine using Vert.x EventBus and JDBC
  └ crabzilla-vertx-web  → Crabzilla engine using Vert.x Web

and your typical *example1* bounded context project will have this structure:

 kotlin-example1             → Project root
  └ example1-kotlin-core     → Your domain code. Services as interfaces. Almost zero dependencies.
  └ example1-kotlin-database → DAOs implementations.
  └ example1-kotlin-service  → The application: wiring, configuration and services implementations.

Load, integration and acceptance tests are against the service module.

The dependencies between the modules:
