Status: *WORK IN PROGRESS*

== Goal for version 1.0.0

To help you write your domain model with very little framework overhead and smoothly deploy it on a state of art Java 8
reactive applications platform backed by a rock solid relational database of your choice.

== Status

So far Crabzilla has only an Aggregate example. Inspired by http://eventstorming.com/[Eventstorming], the goal is to
also develop examples and implementations for an ExternalSystem, a Listener and a ProcessManager / Saga.

== Modules

Crabzilla has these modules:

* crabzilla-core            → Command, DomainEvent, Aggregate, Snapshot, etc Your domain will depend on it.
* crabzilla-vertx-core      → Codecs, Modules, Helpers, etc. Your services will depend on it.
* crabzilla-vertx-handler   → CommandHandlerVerticles and UnitOfWorkRepositories
* crabzilla-vertx-projector → ProjectionHandlerVerticle, EventsProjector and ProjectionRepository
* crabzilla-vertx-web       → CommandRestVerticle using Vert.x Web

The dependencies between the modules:

and your typical *crabzilla-example1* project will have this structure:

* example1-core              → Your domain code. Services as interfaces. Almost zero dependencies.
* example1-handler           → Library exposing command handler verticles for your domain.
* example1-handler-service   → Service (wiring and configuration) exposing commands endpoints.
* example1-projector         → Library exposing projection verticles.
* example1-handler-projector → Service (wiring and configuration) consuming events to be projected.

The granularity of this module is probably a *bounded context*.
